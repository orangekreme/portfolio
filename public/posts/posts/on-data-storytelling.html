    <div class="post-body">
      <p>After two years of building dashboards and financial reports, I've noticed something: the gap between data that informs and data that actually changes behavior is almost never a data problem. It's a narrative problem.</p>

      <p>I've sat in rooms where a perfectly accurate Power BI dashboard got a blank stare from a CFO. And I've seen a simple Excel table with one well-placed callout shift a budget decision in under five minutes. The difference wasn't the data. It was the story wrapped around it.</p>

      <h2>Numbers don't speak for themselves</h2>

      <p>This sounds obvious but it took me longer than I'd like to admit to really internalize it. When I built my first set of dashboards at Morgan Stanley, I was proud of how technically clean they were — the right metrics, accurate reconciliations, dynamic filters. What I hadn't thought enough about was: what decision does this help someone make?</p>

      <p>A dashboard that shows everything equally is really showing nothing. Every time I've had to iterate on a report, the feedback comes down to the same thing: what should I be looking at first?</p>

      <h2>What I've learned about making data land</h2>

      <p>The most effective reports I've built share a few things in common. They start with one clear question — not "here's all the data," but "here's what changed and here's why it matters." They use hierarchy intentionally, guiding the eye from the most important number down to the supporting detail. And they assume the reader is busy and a little skeptical.</p>

      <blockquote>The best analysts I've worked with write like journalists: lead with the headline, then earn the detail.</blockquote>

      <p>I've also started thinking about data quality as a storytelling problem. Bad data doesn't just cause errors — it erodes trust in the narrative. Once an executive catches one wrong number, they start questioning everything. The whole story falls apart. So data governance isn't just a technical concern. It's a credibility concern.</p>

      <p>Still figuring this out as I go. But I think the unlock for me was stopping asking "is this data correct?" and starting to ask "will this data make someone do something different tomorrow?" Those are very different questions.</p>
